\section{Method Selection}

\onehalfspacing

\subsection{Developing situation}

The current situation is under heavy development and undergoing changes almost on a daily basis. To gather most up-to-date expert knowledge, we are asking a panel of experts for their opinion and conduct qualitative interviews

\subsection{Qualitative Research}

\subsubsection{Content Analysis}

As a method for analysis we will be using Qualitative Content Analysis\footnote{See \textit{Mayring, P. (2020)}: Qualitative Content Analysis \cite{qualiContent}}

\subsubsection{Summative Content Analysis} 

Instead of using categories, we will be using Structure formation techniques\footnote{See \textit{Kindermann, K. (2020)}: Summative Content Analysis \cite{summaContent}}

\subsubsection{Expert Panel}

We selected three experts from their field, from Cologne and the surrounding area.

 \item \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/eicker/}{Gerritt Eicker}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interview questionnaire}

Focusing on the three data types, we asked the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item In the current environment, from your point of view, what's the primary legal basis for collecting first-party data?
 \item In the near future (one to three years), how do you see the development of the legal situation for collecting first-party data?
 \item In the current environment, from your point of view, what's the primary legal basis for obtaining second-party data?
 \item In the near future (one to three years), how do you see the development of the legal situation for obtaining second-party data?
 \item In the current environment, from your point of view, what's the primary legal basis for obtaining third-party data?
 \item In the near future (one to three years), how do you see the development of the legal situation for obtaining third-party data?
 \item Taking a wild guess, from a legal point of view, where do you think targeting on the web will be in ten years?
\end{itemize}

The interviews were conducted using \href{https://zoom.us/}{Zoom} and transcribed using \href{https://f4x.audiotranskription.de/}{f4x Spracherkennung}.

In the next and final chapter, we will analyze the interview outcomes.
