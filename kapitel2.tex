\subsection{Targeted Advertising}

\subsubsection{Rationale}

"Microtargeting is a marketing strategy that uses people’s data — about what they like, who they’re connected to, what their demographics are, what they’ve purchased, and more — to segment them into small groups for content targeting. It’s the reason that if you typically shop at Whole Foods, you may be served an advertisement for organic sunscreen during the Summer. And while it can help deliver content that is interesting and helpful to you, it also has a dark side — especially if it delivers information that’s inaccurate or biased and meant to sway your vote."\footnote{\textit{Ghosh, D. (2018)}: What is microtargeting? \cite{mozillaBlog}}
