\section{Interview Analysis}

\onehalfspacing

\subsection{Regarding First Party Data}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

Renate points out that companies should be aware of Art 6 I lit f) DS-GVO as the important legal basis for all technical cookies, and Art 6 I lit a) DS-GVO for any cookie that does not have a technical function, but is used for other purposes, for example user behavior.

For the future Renate sees a strong focus on first party cookies and data, because people will prefer privacy.

\subsubsection{Generalization}

The Most important part

\subsection{Regarding Second Party Data}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

Renate sees Art 6 I lit a) DS-GVO as an issue for companies,  because users do not have to expect that their data is transferred to a second party; she sees no change on this issue in the near future.

\subsubsection{Generalization}

Can work with data brokers / data clean rooms

\subsection{Regarding Third Party Data}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

Renate again sees an issue with Art 6 I lit a) DS-GVO here, as it might be quite difficult to get consent from all parties. She expects it to become even more difficult in the future, because of potentially strict rules of the upcoming e-Privacy act.

\subsubsection{Generalization}

Can work with contract processors, if there's a solid legal framework

\subsection{On a 10-year Outlook}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

Renate expects targeting to become more subtle and more hidden, trying to circumvent privacy regulations.

\subsubsection{Generalization}

The future will be bright and DS-GVO interpreted in a way that allows for both privacy and advertising

\subsection{Overall Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
 \item First party data 
 \item Data clean rooms
 \item Contract processors
 \item Contextual advertising
\end{itemize}
