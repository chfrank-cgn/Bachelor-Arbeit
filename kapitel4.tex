\subsection{Regarding First Party Data}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

\textbf{Renate} points out that companies should be aware of Art 6 I lit f) DS-GVO as the important legal basis for all technical cookies, and Art 6 I lit a) DS-GVO for any cookie that does not have a technical function, but is used for other purposes, for example user behavior.

For the future they see a strong focus on first party cookies and data, because people will prefer privacy.

\textbf{Roman} also puts a strong emphasis on the DS-GVO. Key factor from their point of view is the question, whether one is dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) or not, as this would decide whether the DS-GVO is applicable at all. Based on a recent decision of the EuGH, all data that includes an IP address would be considered personally identifiable - on the internet, that unfortunately applies to a lot of data items, possibly including cookies. Once we've clearly established that the DS-GVO applies to the data in question, the next step would be to determine whether storing and processing it is permissible withing the boundaries of the law. As of today, the primary aspect to consider here seems to be informed consent.

Personally identifiable does mean that it can be traced back to a natural person - this does not necessarily apply to the advertising identifier that we have looked at before, such as FLoC or IDFA.

\textbf{Gerrit} sees first party data as the most important asset for any company. As they collect and own the data, it's part of their core business. Processing first party data from a legal and privacy aspect is relatively easy, it just requires transparency and informed consent. The upcoming TT-DSG will allow functional cookies - for anything else, you'll still need informed consent. 

For any form of marketing, you'll need data; the best data is the data you own. Unlike with second or third party data, once you have consent you can use the data of your visitors or customers to provide the best personalized experience. A good example is Amazon, that only relies on first party data in their advertising.

\subsubsection{Generalization}

First party data - the most important data

\subsection{Regarding Second Party Data}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

\textbf{Renate} sees Art 6 I lit a) DS-GVO as an issue for companies, because users do not have to expect that their data is transferred to a second party; they see no change on this issue in the near future.

\textbf{Roman} also sees an issue with the DS-GVO here, split between the party that sends the data and the party that receives the data. For the sender, it would be necessary to obtain an explicit consent of every person affected - a blanket consent for sharing for marketing purposes (as an example) won't suffice. The same for the receiver - to process the data, it would need consent of all parties involved, which will be very difficult if not impossible to get.

One way around this could be a contract processor agreement, in which case the second party would become an extension of the first party and there would be no data transfer, from a legal point of view.

\textbf{Gerrit} sees the biggest problem in data handling once you start combining data or involving third parties. A possible solution could be intermediate data processors or clean rooms, but they do not see a viable business model for such a service yet.

Once data from different companies gets combined, the danger is that super profiles could emerge, that allow for easy identification of individual persons.

Having said this, in an ideal world from their point of view, all companies would have solid first party data and there were services available that would allow the companies to combine their data in a secure and privacy-aware way. 

\subsubsection{Generalization}

Could work with data brokers, data clean rooms or contract processors

\subsection{Regarding Third Party Data}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

\textbf{Renate} again sees an issue with Art 6 I lit a) DS-GVO here, as it might be quite difficult to get consent from all parties. They expect it to become even more difficult in the future, because of potentially strict rules of the upcoming e-Privacy act.

\textbf{Roman} has a slightly different view and questions whether the mere use of someone else data could be a violation of the DS-GVO. If a company were to ask Google Ads, for example, to place an ad for a car to users that match the car aficionados criteria, they would not be processing personally identifiable data and hence it would not an issue under the DS-GVO. Google showing an ad to their users on their search results page is, by itself, not an issue in regards to data privacy, neither for Google nor for the company placing said advertisement.

If both parties desire a closer cooperation, a contract processor agreement and a solid mechanism to obtain consent could work.

\textbf{Gerrit} sees working with third party data as the biggest issue of all, especially for online marketing. Obtaining public third party data is easy, and some data is even made available voluntarily through the use social media for example.

Given the vast processing power of todays' compute infrastructure, companies can combine individual profiles on almost all individual users - sometimes the profiles might even be more accurate than what the users know about themselves.

What's missing from their point of view is comprehensive regulation on the use of big data on personal profiles, but they do not see a possibility to stop the usage of the data anymore; they even argue that there's no need for further data collection to continue to feed and grow the underlying algorithms that govern our lives.\footnote{See \textit{Kling, M.-U. (2019)}: QualityLand Band 1 \cite{qualityLand}}

\subsubsection{Generalization}

Biggest problem!

Could work with contract processors, if there's a solid legal framework

\subsection{On a 10-year Outlook}

\subsubsection{Paraphrased Interview Content}

\textbf{Renate} expects targeting to become more subtle and more hidden, trying to circumvent privacy regulations.

\textbf{Roman} expects targeting to become easier and foresees a simple mechanism to obtain consent, possibly through a general or per web page browser setting. From their point of view, as a pragmatist, the market demand for targeted advertising will most likely shape legislation in its favor.

\textbf{Gerrit} see the biggest task for the future to educate the people on the use of modern media ("Medienkompetenz").

Furthermore they do not believe that targeting in its current form will be necessary in the long run. With the rise of the ubiquitous digital assistants that can anticipate the needs of the individual user, targeting will become much less important and the systems will be able to use its own feedback to improve and learn.

Nevertheless, given the speed at which technology develops, they expect targeting and tracking to further grow and become all encompassing.

\subsubsection{Generalization}

The future will be bright and DS-GVO interpreted in a way that allows for both privacy and advertising
