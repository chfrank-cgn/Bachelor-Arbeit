\section{Summary}

\onehalfspacing

\subsection{Targeting}

Even though none of the panelists were focusing on contextual advertising, I still see this as the most promising approach in delivering meaningful ads to users while full respecting their privacy.

With the demise of the ubiquitous tracking cookie, other forms of IDs will evolve to support targeted advertising.

\subsection{Method}

Given the volatile state of the subject in 2021, using a qualitative approach has proven very beneficial. Deviating from the classical approach of categories and employing a summative technique have also greatly contributed to the overall result.

\subsection{Outlook}

We will see in 2022 or 2023 which direction advertising will take, we can be sure though that it will remain an integral and important part of the world-wide web infrastructure.

Happy Advertising!
